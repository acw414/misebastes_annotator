# Primer Design Program

Designing new primers for metabarcoding is one of the primary challenges in genomics.
This project seeks to help automate and simplify that process, by taking a limited 
number of inputs from the user (e.g. target group, gene, purpose of primer - like 
eDNA metabarcoding, just amplifying a certain gene, etc.) and churning out primers, with
information included about those primers and how they can be used.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The computational tools needed for this program include ecoPCR, ecoPrimers, OBITools, R, KronaTools,
primer3plus, and perhaps some others. Installation notes to follow below.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

TBD

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

A list of primers will be generated, with information included about the sequence of the primer,
its melting temperature, what species it detects, etc. KronaTools could be used to create an 
infographic about the primers that explains what species are detected by the primers.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
